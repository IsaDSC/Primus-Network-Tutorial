# Primus-Network-Tutorial
We’ll walk through how zkTLS works and how to integrate it into your Dapp or backend using the Primus SDK.


## **Overview**

zkTLS verifies TLS data authenticity while preserving privacy, without modifying servers. It enables secure use of Web2 personal data for efficient cross-platform flow.

Primus provides unified SDKs for both **Dapp** and **Backend** integrations, allowing you to prove any HTTPS data through zkTLS protocols.
